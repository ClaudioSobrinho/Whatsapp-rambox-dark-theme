Welcome to the Whatsapp-rambox-dark-theme wiki!

This is a fork of Prognoz style available [here](https://userstyles.org/styles/142914/whatsapp-dark-theme-by-prognoz) which by itself is also a fork of WA-Web - Dark Skin.

In this version I've made a couple of tweaks to approximate the style to a more material look and to better fit rambox.

### Instalation

1- Open rambox (duh)

2- Go to your enabled services list
3- Select configure on your WhatsApp enabled service (it's the gear icon on that service)
4- Click on Advanced
5- Paste the code from this repository
6- Click on Edit WhatsApp
7- When asked to reload the service, say yes

8- Enjoy
